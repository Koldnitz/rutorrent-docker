# rutorrent-docker

This is a completely functional Docker image with rutorrent, rtorrent, libtorrent and a lot of plug-ins 
for rutorrent, like autodl-irssi, filemanager, fileshare and other useful ones. (IMPORTANT: Be careful, some private trackers
have blacklisted 0.9.6 version. Use 0.9.4 branch instead.)

01/08/2018: NEW: Includes Pyrocore/rtcontrol - http://pyrocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

You need to run pyrocore commands with user "abc", which is who runs rtorrent, so use "su - abc" after connecting container before using pyrocore commands. If you already have torrents in your rtorrent docker instance, you have to add extra information before usinf pyrocore, check here: http://pyrocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html in the "Adding Missing Data to Your rTorrent Session" topic.

Tested and working on Synology and QNAP, but should work on any x86_64 devices.

Instructions:
- Map any local port to 443 for SSL rutorrent access (Default username/password is admin/admin)
- Map any local port to 51415 for rtorrent
- Map a local volume to /config (Stores configuration data, including rtorrent session directory. Consider this on SSD Disk)
- Map a local volume to /downloads (Stores downloaded torrents)

In order to change rutorrent web access password execute this inside container: 
- sh -c "echo -n 'admin:' > /config/nginx/.htpasswd"
- sh -c "openssl passwd -apr1 >> /config/nginx/.htpasswd"

Sample run command:

For rtorrent 0.9.6 version: \

```bash
docker run -d --name=rutorrent \
-v /share/Container/rutorrent-docker/config:/config \
-v /share/Container/rutorrent-docker/downloads:/downloads \
-e PGID=0 -e PUID=0 -e TZ=Europe/Madrid \
-p 9443:443 \
-p 51415-51415:51415-51415 \
romancin/rutorrent:latest
```

For rtorrent 0.9.4 version: \

```bash
docker run -d --name=rutorrent \
-v /share/Container/rutorrent-docker/config:/config \
-v /share/Container/rutorrent-docker/downloads:/downloads \
-e PGID=0 -e PUID=0 -e TZ=Europe/Madrid \
-p 9443:443 \
-p 51415-51415:51415-51415 \
romancin/rutorrent:0.9.4
```

Remember editing /config/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc with your own settings, specially your watch sub-folder configuration.
